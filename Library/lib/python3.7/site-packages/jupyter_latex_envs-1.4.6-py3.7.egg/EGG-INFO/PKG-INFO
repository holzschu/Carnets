Description: (some) LaTeX environments for Jupyter notebook
        ==============================================
        
        This extension for Jupyter notebook enables the use of some LaTeX
        commands and environments markdown cells.
        
        1. **LaTeX commands and environments**
        
           -  support for some LaTeX commands within markdown cells, *e.g.*
              ``\textit``, ``\textbf``, ``\underline``.
           -  support for **theorems-like environments**, support for labels and
              cross references
           -  support for **lists**: *enumerate, itemize*,
           -  limited support for a **figure environment**,
           -  support for an environment *listing*,
           -  additional *textboxa* environment
        
        2. **Citations and bibliography**
        
           -  support for ``\cite`` with creation of a References section
        
        3. **Document-wide numbering of equations and environments, support for
           ``\label`` and ``\ref``**
        4. **Configuration toolbar**
        5. **LaTeX\_envs dropdown menu for a quick insertion of environments**
        6. **User's LaTeX definitions** file can be loaded and used
        7. **Export to plain HTML, Slides and LaTeX with a customized exporter**
        8. Environments title/numbering can be customized by users in
           ``user_envs.json`` config file.
        9. Styles can be customized in the ``latex_env.css`` stylesheet
        10. **Autocompletion** for \$, (, {, [, for LaTeX commands and environments
        
        More environments can be simply added in ``user_envs.json`` or in the
        source file (``thmsInNb4.js``).
        
        It is possible to export the notebooks to plain :math:`\LaTeX` and html
        while keeping all the features of the ``latex_envs`` notebook extension
        in the converted version. We provide specialized exporters, pre and post
        processors, templates. We also added entry-points to simplify the
        conversion process. It is now as simple as
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            jupyter nbconvert --to html_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
        
        or
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            jupyter nbconvert --to latex_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
        
        to convert ``FILE.ipynb`` into html/latex while keeping all the features
        of the ``latex_envs`` notebook extension in the converted version. Other options are 
        ``slides_with_lenvs`` for converting to reveal-js presentations, and ``html_with_toclenvs`` to include a 
        table of contents. The 
        LaTeX converter also expose several conversion options (read the
        `docs <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__).
        
        Demo/documentation
        ------------------
        
        The ``doc`` subdirectory that constains an example notebook and its html
        and pdf versions. This serves as the documentation. A demo notebook
        ``latex_env_doc.ipynb`` is provided. Its html version is
        `latex\_env\_doc.html <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__
        serves as 
        `documentation <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The extension consists of a pypi package that includes a javascript
        notebook extension, along with python code for nbconvert support. Since
        Jupyter 4.2, pypi is the recommended way to distribute nbextensions. The
        extension can be installed
        
        -  from the master version on the github repo (this will be always the
           most recent version)
        -  via pip for the version hosted on Pypi
        -  via conda, from the `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.github.io/>`__
           `channel <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge>`__
        -  as part of the great
           `jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__
           collection. Follow the instructions there for installing. Once this
           is done, you can open a tab at ``http://localhost:8888/nbextensions``
           to enable and configure the various extensions.
        
        From the github repo or from Pypi,
        
        1. install the package
        
           -  ``pip3 install https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/archive/master.zip [--user][--upgrade]``
           -  or ``pip3 install jupyter_latex_envs [--user][--upgrade]``
           -  or clone the repo and install git clone
              https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter\_latex\_envs.git python3
              setup.py install
        
        2. install the notebook extension
        
           ::
        
               jupyter nbextension install --py latex_envs [--user|--sys-prefix|--system]
        
        3. and enable it
        
           ::
        
               jupyter nbextension enable --py latex_envs [--user|--sys-prefix|--system]
        
        For Jupyter versions before 4.2, the situation after step 1 is more
        tricky, since the ``--py`` option isn't available, so you will have to
        find the location of the source files manually as follows (instructions
        adapted from [@jcb91](https://github.com/jcb91)'s
        `jupyter\_highlight\_selected\_word <https://github.com/jcb91/jupyter_highlight_selected_word>`__).
        Execute
        
        ::
        
            python -c "import os.path as p; from latex_envs import __file__ as f, _jupyter_nbextension_paths as n; print(p.normpath(p.join(p.dirname(f), n()[0]['src'])))"
        
        Then, issue
        
        ::
        
            jupyter nbextension install <output source directory>
            jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs/latex_envs
        
        where ``<output source directory>`` is the output of the first python
        command.

        Originally, I used a piece of code from the nice online markdown editor
        `stackedit <https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/187>`__, where
        the authors also considered the problem of incorporating LaTeX markup in
        their markdown.
        
        I also studied and used examples and code from
        `ipython-contrib/jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__.
        
        
        -  This is done in the hope it can be useful. However there are many
           impovements possible, in the code and in the documentation.
           **Contributions will be welcome and deeply appreciated.**
